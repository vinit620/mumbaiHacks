# Problem Statement

India needs its own way to assess creditworthiness beyond just credit scores.
Can AI look at alternative data sources and predict it instead?

### As per data only 0.7% of transactions are done via credit cards. This lack of credit history limits their access to loans and may result in higher interest rates.

Our approach involves using the
user's PAN number to access comprehensive financial data, including cash
flow, transaction history, SIP investments, equity holdings, fixed
deposits, bonds, commodities, and insurance. By analyzing these factors,
we will create a credibility rating between 300 and 900 similar to credit score, providing a more holistic assessment of the user's ability to repay loans.
